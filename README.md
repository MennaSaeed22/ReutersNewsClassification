# Reuters-21578 Dataset Overview

The Reuters-21578 dataset is a collection of documents containing news articles. Originally, 
the corpus comprises 10,369 documents and has a vocabulary of 29,930 unique words.

## Multi-label Classification

Multi-label classification is a common supervised machine learning problem where each instance can be associated with multiple classes. 
The primary challenge in this problem lies in learning the correlations between these classes.

## Challenges with Noisy Labels

An additional challenge arises when the labels of the training instances are provided by noisy, 
heterogeneous crowdworkers with unknown qualities. Initially, assuming labels from a perfect source can help in modeling the problem effectively.

## objective

This project seeks to analyze a dataset formatted in XML, utilizing multilabel classification and natural language processing techniques to categorize the data. Additionally, 
it addresses noise within the dataset. Furthermore, it involves comparing the results obtained through multilabel classification with those achieved through multiclass classification.
